100 Days of Code Challenge ðŸš€
Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge! This repository contains all the code, projects, and progress from my journey as I commit to coding for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

What is #100DaysOfCode?
The #100DaysOfCode challenge is a commitment to code every day for 100 consecutive days and to share your progress with the community. Itâ€™s a great way to learn, grow, and build consistency in coding skills, while also being part of a larger developer community.

My Goals ðŸŽ¯
Improve my proficiency in Python.
Build real-world projects and applications.
Learn and explore new technologies, libraries, and frameworks.
Document my progress and share what I learn with others.
